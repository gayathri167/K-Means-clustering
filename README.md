# K-Means-clustering
The K-Means algorithm aims to partition a set of data points into K clusters based on feature similarity.The algThis project implements the K-Means Clustering algorithm, which groups data points into a predefined number of clusters (K). It demonstrates the basic steps of K-Means, including initialization, assignment, and update of centroids.
